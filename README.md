# ytmp3dl-chrome

YouTube mp3 downloader - chrome extension module. This Chrome extension adds a download button to YouTube as well as an extension popup from which downloads can be started from a _bookmarks_ folder or using either a video id or a YouTube url.

This project is cloned from the old `prodl` project, this project has been motified slightly to work with `ytmp3dl-server`. The popup works and is able to connect to `ytmp3dl-server`, a basic download button is also conveniently inserted into YouTube (top right of screen) when watching a video, from which downloads can be started.
